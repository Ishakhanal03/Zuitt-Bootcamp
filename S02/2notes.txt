to print a string:
1. we can use concatenation method :- used only for string value and can only print string variable 
					uses "+" symbol
2. we can use fstring :- can be used to print any type of datatypes in the program like int , string etc 
syntax:
print(f"stament{variable_name1} statement {variable_name2}...."
Example
print(f"My name is {full_name} and my age is {age}!")
where full_name is variable storing string value and age is storing int value
